## GOLDEN RULES OF DESIGN
### CONSISTENCY
 - Same circular shaped icons for unified design
 - Widgets have same rounded edge motif for familiarity
### FEEDBACK 
 - Widgets instantly pop in or exit for snappy feedback
### SHORT TERM MEMORY LOAD
 - Actions do not take more than a simple click or swipe
### ERROR HANDLING
 - User experience is enhanced by being shown error rather than having system crashing
